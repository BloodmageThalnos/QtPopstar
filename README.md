# Popstar
This is a PC version of a game that had been quite popular on Android, which is called 'Popstar'.
## Installation
If you want to try this game, just download Popstar.exe and run it on Windows. Make sure Qt environment resides on your computer, or you might have to bring some essential dlls.
## Environment
The project is written in C++, with Qt as GUI engine. The offical IDE of Qt, Qt Creater, is used in this project. (But you can also compile it in VS, if you have Qt environment.)

## Todo
- There are some bugs when game sound and background music are played. Maybe some different sound player should be used.
- Actually only 3 levels are there in the Challenge mode, and the level 3 is almost unsolvable... Maybe some more interesting levels should be designed.
- Maybe some adventure or achievements can be added into the game, to make it more playable.
